# Work in progress
## Goal of this repository

This is a basic .dotfiles repo designed to centralize my linux configuration for an easy installation on other machines. 
Coupled with my ansible playbook ( ansible repository ). 
Everything should be fast and practical enough to have full i3 config installed and ready to used with a simple command.
